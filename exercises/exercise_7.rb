# Your code goes here ...
# Add validations
# - Employees must always have a first name present
# - Employees must always have a last name present
# - Employees have a hourly_rate that is a number (integer) between 40 and 200
# - Employees must always have a store that they belong to (can't have an employee that is not assigned a store)
# - Stores must always have a name that is a minimum of 3 characters
# - Stores have an annual_revenue that is a number (integer) that must be 0 or more
# - BONUS: Stores must carry at least one of the men's or women's apparel (hint: use a [custom validation method](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#custom-methods) - **don't** use a `Validator` class)
