# Your code goes here ...
# 1. Output the total revenue for the entire company (all stores), using Active Record's `.sum` calculation method.
total_revenue = Store.sum(:annual_revenue);

# 2. On the next line, also output the average annual revenue for all stores.
average_revenue = Store.average(:annual_revenue);

# 3. Output the number of stores that are generating $1M or more in annual sales. **Hint:** Chain together `where` and `size` (or `count`) Active Record methods.

Store.where("annual_revenue > ?", 1000000).count
